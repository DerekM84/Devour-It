# Devour-It

## Simple App design to implement concepts of connection. 

In this project, the idea is to separate all of our full-stack code into separate files. We then organize them into the Models, Views, Config layout. Once the file system is in place, we use different routes and requires to connect all the peices together and handle user requests. 

On the front side, the user will see a simple interface with the ability to add, move, and delete objects. This data is handled through an express server's router and ORM models to reach the MYSQL database. 

Using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), we can make the models to form queries for us which makes our routing more efficient.
